            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>
                Within <strong>1 month</strong> and a fixed budget of <strong>10.000 €</strong>, we will
                aim to finish <strong>1 MVP</strong>.
            </p>
            <h3>What is an MVP?</h3>
            <p>
                We define the »Minimum Viable Product« as the first good version of a website / web app
                which we can launch and show to the world. This first version is already fast, scalable,
                secure and of high quality - but does not yet have all the features.</p>
            <h3>Why 10.000 €?</h3>
            <p>
                10.000 € is a good balance for an MVP - it’s not a fully-featured website yet, but can
                do more and is more thought out than a simple hackathon-project.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve been to projects with a budget of 3.000 EUR, but the code was often ugly,
                not secured and of low to very low quality.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other side of the spectrum, I've seen 50.000+ EUR projects that never launched,
                because new features kept getting added. The code base grew larger and larger, fixing
                the website became more difficult, and in the end, development was halted.
            </p>
            <h3>Why 1 month?</h3>
            <p>
                Some try to launch within a week, but usually such a project doesn’t give great value yet.
                On the other side, waiting a year or more to finally launch, you will miss opportunities
                to get feedback from customers. Maybe 50% of the features are not really needed - but you
                won’t know since no customer can test the product.
            </p>
            <p>
                1 month gives us enough time to plan and develop, but not enough time to have »feature bloat«.
            </p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <h3>Phase 1: Discovery</h3>
            <p>
                Initial consultation where we will go through the requirements, features, long-term
                goals and quick check »under the hood« and current state (e.g. what’s working, what’s missing,
                what’s problematic).
            </p>
            <h3>Phase 2: Roadmapping / Concept</h3>
            <p>
                We plan the next steps and set the long-term goals and agree on the tools to create the website
                / web app. This roadmap is a continuous process to make sure we’re always on the same page.
            </p>
            <h3>Phase 3: »Ugly Duckling«</h3>
            <p>
                Iterative development - we code, design, create the infrastructure and set up
                as much as possible. We try to add design elements, but focus is on the functionality
                and user experience, we want to make sure everything works.
            </p>
            <h3>Phase 4: Merge</h3>
            <p>
                Once the functionality is there and the infrastructure is set up, we finalize the last
                points.
            </p>
            <h3>Modules</h3>
            <p>
                Depending on what your needs are (web app for a startup, niche online shop, landing
                page for a specific product), we will use different tools. These are some of the tools
                we use:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom development</strong> if you are creating a functional app
                    that does not really exist yet in its functionality</li>
                <li><strong>A/B-Testing</strong> in case you want to test and check your pages
                    for effectiveness</li>
                <li><strong>User Tracking</strong> to find out what your users are doing on the
                    website</li>
                <li><strong>Online Shop System</strong> using Shopify with (either just the backend or
                    full system) for creating scalable small to medium-sized online shops.</li>
                <li><strong>SEO (Search Engine Optimizatin)</strong> in case your focus is finding clients
                    via content</li>
                <li><strong>Newsletter Marketing</strong> if you want to create long-term trust and branding
                    with your users</li>
            </ul>
